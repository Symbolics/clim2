;;; All of this is taken from the STREAM-DEFINITION-BY-USER proposal to
;;; the X3J13 committee, made by David Gray of TI on 22 March 1989.  No
;;; Lisp implementation yet supports this proposal, so we implement it
;;; here in this separate package.  This way we will be ready when some
;;; Lisp implementation adopts it (or something like it).

;;; This file defines classes in the Gray proposal, plus class-based
;;; predicates.  This file is entirely #-CLIM-uses-Lisp-stream-classes,
;;; which means that any class and function names are shadowed in this
;;; package (not inherited from the CL package).
